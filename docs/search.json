    "text": "My main research interests are causal inference and time-to-event analysis. In particular, I am interested in methods for estimating the effects of time-varying treatments, time-dependent confounding and other sources of bias in longitudinal settings, time-to-event data, competing risk and multi-state modelling. I also have an interest in studies of infectious diseases and the estimation of treatment effects in such settings, and I have done some work on excess mortality estimation, infectious disease surveillance and infectious disease modelling.\nI am interested in applications using both randomised and observational data, and in particular event history data constructed from linked clinical and population-wide registries. I am currently involved in various collaborative projects, e.g. on the effects of rehabilitation and pain medication on patient outcomes after traumatic injury with researchers at the Oslo University Hospital, and on the effects of rehabilitation and workplace initiatives on long-term sick leave and work-related outcomes with researchers at the National Institute of Occupational Health in Norway, with funding from the Research Council of Norway and the Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, University of Oslo. Through my work at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health I’m involved in projects on the estimation of vaccine effects from observational data.\nSee my Google Scholar profile for publications."

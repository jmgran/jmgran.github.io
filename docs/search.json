    "text": "My main research interests are in methods for causal inference and event history analysis. In particular, I’m interested in the analysis of longitudinal data, including time-varying treatments and confounding, and time-to-event outcomes, including settings with competing risks and more general multi-state outcomes. I also have an interest in the study of infectious diseases, and the added complexities of causal inference in such settings.\nI am interested in applications using data from both randomised and observational studies, and in particular data from clinical and population-wide registries. I am currently involved in different collaborative projects, e.g. on the effects of rehabilitation and medications used for pain treatment (such as opioids) on patient outcomes after traumatic injury, with researchers at the Oslo University Hospital, and on the effects of rehabilitation and workplace initiatives on long-term sick leave and work-related outcomes, with researchers at the National Institute of Occupational Health in Norway. For these projects, we have receive funding from the Research Council of Norway, and the Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, University of Oslo. At the Norwegian Institute of Public Health I’m involved in applied and methodological projects on the estimation of vaccine effects.\nSee my Google Scholar profile for publications."

In 2025 we will hold a shorter version of this course as a pre-conference course at the Nordic-Baltic Biometric Conference in Oslo."

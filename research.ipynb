In particular, I have worked on methods for estimating the effects of time-varying treatments on survival outcomes under time-dependent confounding and multi-state modelling of event history data. I also have an interest in studies of infectious diseases, and have done some work on topics such as excess mortality, infectious disease surveillance and infectious disease modelling.\n",

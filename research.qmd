My main research interests are in methods for causal inference and event history analysis. In particular, I'm interested in the analysis of longitudinal data, including time-varying treatments and confounding, and time-to-event outcomes, including settings with competing risks and more general multi-state outcomes. I also have an interest in the study of infectious diseases, and the added complexities of causal inference in such settings.

I am interested in applications using data from both randomised and observational studies, and in particular data from clinical and population-wide registries. I am currently involved in different collaborative projects, e.g. on the effects of rehabilitation and medications used for pain treatment (such as opioids) on patient outcomes after traumatic injury, with researchers at [the Oslo University Hospital](https://www.ous-research.no/ipot/){target="_blank"}, and on the effects of rehabilitation and workplace initiatives on long-term sick leave and work-related outcomes, with researchers at [the National Institute of Occupational Health in Norway](https://stami.no/en/){target="_blank"}. For these projects, we have receive funding from the Research Council of Norway, and the Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, University of Oslo. At [the Norwegian Institute of Public Health](https://www.fhi.no/en/){target="_blank"} I'm involved in applied and methodological projects on the estimation of vaccine effects.

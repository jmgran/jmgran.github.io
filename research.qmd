My main research interests are causal inference and time-to-event analysis. In particular, I am interested in methods for studying time-varying treatments, time-dependent confounding and other sources of bias in longitudinal settings, time-to-event outcomes, competing risk problems and more general multi-state modelling. I also have an interest in infectious diseases, including the added complexities of estimating treatment effects in such settings, estimation of excess mortality and infectious disease surveillance and modelling.

I am interested in applications using data from both randomised and observational studies, and in particular event history data constructed from linked clinical and population-wide registries. I am currently involved in various collaborative projects, e.g. on the effects of rehabilitation and pain medication on patient outcomes after traumatic injury with researchers at [the Oslo University Hospital](https://www.ous-research.no/ipot/){target="_blank"}, and on the effects of rehabilitation and workplace initiatives on long-term sick leave and work-related outcomes with researchers at [the National Institute of Occupational Health in Norway](https://stami.no/en/){target="_blank"}, with funding from the Research Council of Norway and the Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, University of Oslo. At [the Norwegian Institute of Public Health](https://www.fhi.no/en/){target="_blank"} I'm involved in projects on the estimation of vaccine effects.

    "text": "My main research interests are causal inference and time-to-event analysis. In particular, I have worked on methods for estimating the effects of time-varying treatments on survival outcomes under time-dependent confounding and multi-state modelling of event history data. I also have an interest in studies of infectious diseases, and have done some work on topics such as vaccine effectiveness, excess mortality, infectious disease surveillance and infectious disease modelling.\nI am interested in applications using both randomised and observational data, and in particular event history outcomes construced using data from linked clinical and population-wide registries. I am currently involved in various collaborative projects, e.g. on the effects of rehabilitation and pain medication on patient outcomes after traumatic injury with researchers at the Oslo University Hospital, and on the effects of rehabilitation and workplace initiatives on long-term sick leave and work-related outcomes with researchers at the National Institute of Occupational Health in Norway. I currently lead research projects with funding from the Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, University of Oslo, and from the Research Council of Norway.\nSee my Google Scholar profile for publications."

In 2025 we will hold a shorter version of this course as a pre-conference course at the Nordic-Baltic Biometric Conference in Oslo."

    "text": "My main research interests are causal inference and time-to-event analysis. In particular, I’m interested in the analysis of longitudinal data, including time-varying treatments and confounding, and time-to-event outcomes, including settings with competing risks and more general multi-state outcomes. I also have an interest in the study of infectious diseases, and the added complexities of causal inference in such settings.\nI am interested in applications using data from both randomised and observational studies, and in particular event history data constructed from linked clinical and population-wide registries. I am currently involved in various collaborative projects, e.g. on the effects of rehabilitation and medications used for pain treatment (such as opioids) on patient outcomes after traumatic injury, with researchers at the Oslo University Hospital, and on the effects of rehabilitation and workplace initiatives on long-term sick leave and work-related outcomes, with researchers at the National Institute of Occupational Health in Norway. The projects receive funding from the Research Council of Norway, and the Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, University of Oslo. At the Norwegian Institute of Public Health I’m involved in applied and methodological projects on the estimation of vaccine effects.\nSee my Google Scholar profile for publications."
